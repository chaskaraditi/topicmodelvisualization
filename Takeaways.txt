To trust AI, make it explainable
A trustworthy AI system is a good AI system
For AI to be considered trustworthy, it must be available when it is supposed to be available and must generate consistent and reliable outputs
Trustworthy requires explainability, accountability, being unbiassed, resilient and reliable
AI agents need to be trustworthy, accountable and reliable
To ensure that AI will have good opportunities, people should evaluate that if AI will meet explainable requirements
For AI to be trustworthy, it must be open for inspection, and its decisions must be fully explainable
To increase trust on an AI system, we should strive to make the interfaces explainable, accountable, unbiased, resilient and reliable
With increasing penchant for Explainable AI, consumers will be more encouraged to trust in advanced AI applications
Trustworthy AI systems must be FEARED Fair Explainable Accountable Resilient Explicit and Diverse
AI system must be able to generate outputs that are explainable, accountable, unbiased, resilient, transparent and reliable in order to earn customers trust and satisfaction
The trustworthiness of AI systems is largely dependent on its predictability and how explainable the results it yields are. Thus, good AI opportunities are explainable, but not all explainable AI opportunities are good AI opportunities.
Explainable AI has come to stay, everybody wants an interpretable system. Why the AI system makes a decision must be clearly stated
Response Complexity and Response Time are critical concepts in building explainable AI
Good AI systems should be easily explainable
An important factor is trust. Making AI models trustworthy is the only way people will adopt them. A common answer to what makes AI trustworthy here was accountability which was interesting as AI are machines, and a part of accountability is taking responsibility for the outcome of something
AI should be explainable what it means is it whatever actions it does, those actions should be trustworthy and in favor of humans
A reliable AI system should include 5 characteristics explainable, accountable, unbiased, resilient, reliable
Make sure that your AI system is explainable and complemented by others for it to be trustworthy
Interlinking legal and ethical notions, i.e. explainability or trustworthy, to the concept of a good business idea
Given that AI systems allow to predict outcomes, businesses need to consider AIs as agents within the company. There exists a possibility to react and pivot from an idea situation given a AI prediction
AI helps organization to predict crucial outcomes, prescribe advice preventive measures, decide to implement the best action plan and also helps to monitor the same based on multiple inputs which requires human intelligence. Thus, AI acts as an agent for organization
AI can potentially predict the outcome of an event through self learning
A good AI opportunity is the one add value in terms of scalability, easiness, rapid development and trust worthy
It is important to validate our AI opportunity before starting to implement it
A good AI opportunity is supposed to do good and make money concurrently
The possibilities of using AI are endless, it is therefore advisable that every organization system seeks to embed it into its working process. To start this off, it is worthy understand the working system of the unit to be accessed
AI can be applied to every sector to enable new possibilities and efficiencies
AI systems are the future and for it to be a 100% effective, we must trust that it will be used for good causes. Just like internet in its early stage was feared but now one can imagine life without it, AI also is a very great system.
Make AI trustworthy, lack of trust is hindering its adoption
AI is still not that much trustworthy because at some place somewhere the data is saving and accessing by humans. which can be hacked or misused. So AI needs to be more trustworthy.
We can use AI system to work on simple humanly possible work to ensure that it is trustworthy
Companies are well equipped with AI but need to build trust in their systems
AI is just the agent, the outcome of using AI and whether we get to trust the system or not depends on how we use them.
An AI system needs to be trustworthy, otherwise people will fear it and will not use it.
To solve a problem, it is important to use AI that is trusted by people.
To gain the most out of AI agents we must ensure it is trustworthy
The use of AI agents as employment will resonate more with countries that lack the required software tools
The dependency on machines to solve human problems will cause lack of participation from educational facilities, since our job is now seen as logging in data
While working or developing a good AI opportunities First, define the problem statement which focus towards customers need and fulfilling organisation objective, then define solution ,select the solution and validate that it is good AI opportunity or not and at the end exploit the opportunity
Take it easy on losing job, for AI is just taking the laboring and logical analysis positions, those jobs which need ethics, or we can say, humanity will still be undertaken by human for a long time
Ideas coexist with opportunities, but ideas are not the same as opportunities, and obviously opportunities are less than ideas. Similarly, there is a big gap between opportunities and good opportunities, not to mention good AI opportunities. Good AI opportunities must be clear about what customers want, which is the ultimate goal and requirement.
A good AI opportunity is one which provides value proposition to the customer organization in terms of benefits, costs and growth.
Users and customers must be involved in AI applications
A good AI opportunity can be found among options by elimination when the options are ranked by the importance to the customer and value gained
Trust and ethics are fundamental to any AI solutions for acceptability by the users
Incorporating immersive AI into the customer experience to boost engagement shifting the focus from technology to business opportunity
AI is denoted as an agent for organisations. AI Agents are far more effective and efficient processing information than the humans
AI needs more than technical skills such as statistics or programming, it needs ethics and values and some of your sales abilities
AI tries to solve problems. So, we could use it with any type issues we have inside institutions. The know how depends on the doer
The best opportunities for AI are when it helps to improve the customers lifestyles and company decisions-making
Using AI integrates the supply chain of organisations	
AI makes important in increasing cost, used efficiently and making understandable for the users
Customer satisfaction is paramount in determining good AI opportunities
Wondering how to recognize a good AI opportunity? look for where customers get less value for money
In order to drive an AI system to create value, it is required that the benefited user receives a clear and meaningful output and explanation. Users will feel discouraged to trust a complex detailed system.
AI improves the decision-making processes of individuals and organisations, making them more efficient
Artificial Intelligence systems are trusted for their positive impact to users
It is important for the user to understand the AI system to trust it
AI is an agent to company, organisation and entity
AI agents provide many advantages to an organisation than humans do not
Giving priority to costumer s interest by focusing on customers needs and satisfaction
A good AI opportunity can be an important customer need which current solution is not enough
Good opportunity should be oriented toward a real need and problem of the customer beneficiary
AI is required to maintain and sustain businesses and institutions around us
AI has role to play in cybersecurity
AI must be focused on a problem that is growing and is of importance to the customer
AI agents in an organisation have greater ability to process and store information than humans do
AI systems creates an avenue to harness potential opportunities that are low in customer satisfaction and are of high importance to customers
AI enterprises should clearly explain to users the places involving users privacy. If the user is willing to provide the data for testing, it should give the user a clear guarantee and let the user know that the data will be permanently deleted after it is used up
A good AI system will make customers feel that what they have currently is not enough
An AI system is distinct because 1. AI is about computer systems that perform tasks that normally require human intelligence 2. Must trust AI systems to drive positive benefits to our lives, communities, companies, and countries 3.AI is an agent for organizations
In order to trust AI, we need to understand, in order to understand we need to search for opportunities and solution in our communities. We need to work hard to make AI trustworthy because this will make its adoption easier in our organizations
The most valuable companies in the world use AI, start-ups and entrepreneurs must use AI if they want to grow fast
Entrepreneurs are important in aiding AI for development of ideas and motivations.
AI can give a huge competitive advantage to start-up companies and should be carefully considered
It is possible to cultivate a community where AI is a trusted agent
AI plays an important role in company and communityvalue creation
AI provides power to regime and build communities by building its trust
AI has many benefits; however, we do not trust it. For us to trust AI, we must understand it and learn how to control it to create value for us and our communities
Enlighten different companies, universities, communities about the importance of AI
Need to select an institution in my community to become an AI leader
Must trust AI systems to drive positive benefits to our lives, communities, companies, and countries
A symbiotic relationship exists between AI and entrepreneurs it all depends on how we take it
While AI systems are dependant on data that may be used for declared or undeclared plans, we better trust AI to benefit our lives, communities and companies
The use of AI in my community should reduce complexities
The community in which AI systems are used must trust its ability to drive positive benefits to their lives
AI system must be trusted in order to drive the positive benefits to our communities, companies, and countries.
Create AI opportunities that make an impact in communities
Humans as well as AI agents contribute to adding value to communities
AI agents makes us dependant on them
We need to understand AI to share this reality and need to improve our community and that will only happen when the machine trusts us and we trust the machines
Must trust AI system to drive positive benefits to our lives, communities, companies, and countries, it can also work as an agent for organizations.
Entrepreneurs use AI because they need them as agents
AI is distinct because it can perform many tasks that normally require human intelligence
Value added by a solution through AI could be an opportunity for making money and become and entrepreneur
Entrepreneurs need AI
The ability to create value for communities is a key feature of a good AI opportunity
To have a good opportunity, four key components are necessary: 1) Address a problem that is important, growing, widespread, urgent and manifests in diverse ways, 2) What you sell should have an all-encompassing benefit, 3) Lead a versatile and efficient team, and 4) Champion the opportunity with unwavering confidence
A good opportunity is obtained when you have a defined problem, the knowledge about what you sell, a well-built efficient team that can lead to success and the way you champion it
People are more comfortable with a product, brand or system they can trust, hence trust becomes the first commodity a company should aim at selling before the actual product, once trust is established
A good opportunity can be designed
Artificial Intelligence systems can help perforate organizational boundaries and allow them launch into new realms of value creations
AI agents in organizations makes decision more algorithmic less fuzzy , dispassionate less emotional , more logical less intuitive reduce information asymmetries among human parties who are part of a transaction
Artificial Intelligence is not emotional, It has reasons why making a decision which are logical, rationale and algorithmic
If we want to have a solution for an argument we should make an algorithm for it and all of a sudden it makes clear
Thanks to Artificial Intelligence, a program can compute tasks that normally require human intelligence. Hence, a program using Artificial Intelligence is like have an additional worker agent in the company community that makes decisions more algorithmic, dispassionate, and more logical than an average human
It is called narrow artificial intelligence because it is real and it is here today. This is not comic book stuff. We started talking about artificial intelligence in 1956, but the problem was that all we could do was talk about it. It has not been until recently that we have been able to USE it to do good things!
Majority of the implementation of artificial intelligence in our environments are Weak Narrow Artificial Intelligence
AI have two kind of classes 1. General artificial intelligence which are comparable to or exceeds human intelligence and slower adoption. 2. Narrow artificial intelligence, this kind of AI only can accomplish a limited set of goals but have faster adoption
Two AI classes General Narrow. 1 General comparable or exceeds human intelligence. Usually slower to adopt 2 Narrow accomplishes specific tasks e.g. recommendations, predict sales etc . Faster to adopt
You start with a big problem but you have to narrow it down!!
Program will focus on narrow artificial intelligence applications
AI as a topic started in 1956. Tools Technologies made available recently only have helped in using Artificial Intelligence at work
AI should be able to have ability to understand, decide, plan, communicate, critique on topics, have a reasonable response to every action
Remember to consider the 7 listed factors to create stakeholder value
By deploying skilled AI agents, the system could predict, prescribe, react, and perform actions that require human intelligence
AI increases dominance and political power of developed countries
AI has the potential to provide precision production e.g. in agriculture, manufacturing etc.
The application of AI in agriculture improves a nation’s food security
AI plays a very key role in any nation’s prosperity
AI is a source of power technologically and geopolitically
AI will certainly help small scale industries to compete at international levels by updating them technologically
It is a good idea to validate any developed AI solution to ensure that it is a good AI opportunity before implementation
AI could increase the differences between developed and developing countries if the latter do not adapt quickly to change
External and internal resources should be combined to create high value. Resources include assets, processes and priorities
Assets, processes and priorities do not exist in isolation
Artificial intelligence does not waste resources
AI can be employed in universities from infrastructure up to the running of academic programs and imparting knowledge for better results
It is important to identify good opportunities to deploy AI, not just opportunities. This will allow us to put our effort and resources in something worthy and not lose time
Entrepreneur continuously creates value for people by combining resources in a novel way. Some of the company’s value remains with them some goes to resource owner then they attract other resources which increase the company’s value. Therefore, creating more value for the company is an iterative process
AI can address opportunities that could not be addressed before and it is capable of high-stake decisions in the most efficient way
AI helps us tackle the problems which otherwise could not be addressed. It helps in evolving technologies cost effectively and efficiently and it is a very important element of high-stake decision processes.
An idea or opportunity does not necessarily imply good AI opportunity, a good AI opportunity entails well defined problem to be addressed in an efficient and effective manner to have long lasting and far reaching benefits.
Not only all AI legal implications you should also follow ethical implications i.e., having concern about security, hacking etc
A Good AI Opportunity needs to have a genuine problem to be addressed that offers a huge impact
In developing a good AI opportunity, it is better to focus first on achieving short-term goals and then gradually climb focus on achieving long-term goals as your sphere expands. So, you can set both goals and as you achieve the first, the second is gradually being achieved
Your AI needs your trust, in other words, your concise design paves way to scenarios in which the human intelligence required for certain tasks are achieved more effectively and accurately
How to check performance of AI trustworthiness with conforming basic parameter, i.e., explainable, accountable, unbiased, reliable, and resilient
AI courses require us to work hard to learn and explore the logic and mysteries, no one can casually achieve success, perseverance is rewarding
